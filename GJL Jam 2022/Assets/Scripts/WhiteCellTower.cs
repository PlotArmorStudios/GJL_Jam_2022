    /// <summary>
    /// The purpose of this script, is to act as the 'brains' and body of a tower defense
    /// IE: "Spawn pellets" at enemies, with the projectile script. Starting with the nearest one.
    /// And failing that, die/despawn after a set amount of time, 5 seconds by default.
    /// -
    /// As said, it also has a 'timed' limit on how long it should last in-game.
    /// By default, it's 5 seconds. But maybe, that time limit could be tripled/quadupled?
